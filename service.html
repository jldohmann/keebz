        General info
    </h2>
    <p>
    The biggest thing I ask that you keep in mind is that custom keyboards can become pretty pricey because of materials and manufacturing costs: low range boards are typically around $150-$250. There are things we can do to keep costs down but ultimately <strong>please know your budget ahead of time, and calibrate your expectations accordingly</strong>. If you have questions or aren't sure what you want to do, that's why I'm here! Please feel free to fill out the form and note that you would like a consultation: it's absolutely no charge for you and I'd be happy to chat!
    </p>
    <p>
        If you need a quick introduction to mechanical keyboard sizes and layouts, please see the Keyboard University course: <a href="https://keyboard.university/100-courses/keyboard-sizes-layouts">Keyboard Sizes & Layouts</a>

    <h2>
        Process
    </h2>
    <p>
        Here is what you can expect from my commission process:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill out the form with your name, email and other information asked</li>
        <li>I will contact you and setup a 15-30 minute virtual meeting</li>
        <li>If we come to an agreement, I will send you a service contract with all the relevant information</li>
        <li>Depending on the arrangement, I will invoice you for materials or you will send them yourself</li>
        <li>I build your board, invoice you for the build and shipping and send it over</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
        Rates
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have different rates for different services. If the service requires sourcing materials, I will only be building a 60% board or macropad at this time. If you have or desire a hot swappable board, you can deduct $10 off the service. Below are my rates: 
    </p>

    <p>Assembly</p>
    <ul>
        <li>$50 standard 60% ANSI layout</li>
        <ul>
            <li>switch lubing included for linears and tactiles</li>
            <li>stabilizer modification included</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>Desoldering</p>
    <ul>
        <li>$40 for boards under TKL</li>
        <li>$60 for boards TKL and larger</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Modifying</p>
    <ul>
        <li>$30 for standard 60% and under</li>
        <li>$40 for larger than 60%</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At this time I do not offer standalone switch lubing services. If you're local though, we might be able to work something out.</p>
